# 🍓 **App Development: Data Structures and Algorithms** 📚

Welcome to **Booked**, an app development project focused on data structures and algorithms for book tracking and recommendations.

## 🚀 **Features**

- **🔖 Book Tracking**: Keep track of the books you have finished and reading list.
- **🔍 Google Books API**: Use of the Google Books API to fetch detailed information about books, including title, author, description, cover, and more.
- **📖 Recommendation Algorithm**: Algorithm that analyzes the user's finished books to suggests new books based on their preferences.
- **🔮 Future Improvements**: Improve the recommendation algorithm to achieve greater accuracy and efficiency by including the genres of books read, as well as book ratings and similarities with other users. Exploring alternative data structures to improve performance is also on the roadmap.

## 💻 **Technologies Used**

- **SwiftUI**: To create the user interface.
- **Swift Data**: Manage and persist user reading lists and finished books within the application.
- **Google Books API**: Integration with the Google Books API allows the application to fetch comprehensive information about books.
- **Algorithms**: Implementation of an algorithm to analyze user data and generate book recommendations.
